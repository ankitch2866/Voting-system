# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Description
A decentralized and secure voting system powered by blockchain technology. This project leverages Ethereum smart contracts to ensure transparency, immutability, and fairness in the voting process. The system includes voter registration, vote casting, and result calculation features.

---

## Features
- **Decentralized**: Votes are recorded on a blockchain to ensure transparency.
- **Secure**: Blockchain guarantees tamper-proof data storage.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive voting interface.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to various voting scenarios.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (`Flask` or `Django`), `web3.py`
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Ganache for testing), Solidity
- **Tools**: Ganache, Remix IDE

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikosane/Blockchain-Voting-System.git
cd Blockchain-Voting-System
```

### 2. Set Up Blockchain
- Install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) and start a local blockchain.

### 3. Deploy Smart Contract
- Compile and deploy `Voting.sol` using Remix or a Python script with `web3.py`.

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Backend
```bash
python backend/app.py
```

### 6. Access the Frontend
- Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser.

## Usage

1. **Start the Blockchain**
   - Run Ganache and connect to the network.

2. **Deploy the Contract**
   - Deploy the smart contract using the provided scripts or Remix.

3. **Vote**
   - Use the web interface to register and cast votes.

4. **View Results**
